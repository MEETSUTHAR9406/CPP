# C++ Learning Repository

A repository documenting my journey of learning **C++ from scratch**, including exercises, examples, and concepts.  
Currently, I have completed topics **up to Vectors** in C++.

---

## About

- Language: **C++**
- Focus: Learning **core C++ concepts**, **problem-solving**, and **hands-on coding**
- Current Status: **Lectures completed up to Vectors**
- Learning Path: Basics → Functions → Arrays → Vectors → (Next: Strings, Pointers, STL, Projects)

## Concepts Covered So Far

### Basics
- Syntax and structure of C++ programs  
- Input/Output (`cin`, `cout`)  
- Variables and Data Types (`int`, `float`, `char`, `bool`, etc.)  
- Constants and `const` keyword  

### Operators
- Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`)  
- Assignment operators (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.)  
- Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`)  
- Logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`)  

### Control Structures
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`, `switch`)  
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)  
- `break` and `continue` statements  

### Functions
- Defining and calling functions  
- Function parameters and return values  
- Scope of variables (local and global)  
- Function overloading basics  

### Arrays
- One-dimensional arrays  
- Multi-dimensional arrays (2D arrays)  
- Array traversal and manipulation  
- Passing arrays to functions  

### Vectors (STL Basics)
- Declaring vectors (`vector<int> v;`)  
- Adding/removing elements (`push_back()`, `pop_back()`)  
- Accessing elements (`v[i]`, `v.at(i)`)  
- Iterating through vectors (for loop, iterators)  
- Basic vector operations (`size()`, `empty()`, `clear()`)
